# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
Using the Citi Bike dataset, an analysis is performed on the feasability of applying a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The New York City's 2019 August data is broken down into 3 main categories of the market: age, gender, and time. Based on these categories, visualizations are created using Tableau Public to suit the analyst's perspective as well as any future investors of the program. All of the charts are uploaded on the Tableau Server to be shared.

- The checkout times divided by gender shows the same trend for all male and female peaking at 5 minutes per ride while the unkown category peaks at 10 minutes per ride. 
- The peaktimes for the month of August can be divided into morning and afternoon times, where the morning peak hours is between 8 to 9 am and the afternoon starts at 4 to 7pm. 
- The heatmap divided by the days and time shows the same result for the peak hours during the weekday however, during the weekend shows a more steady time between 9am all the way to 7pm. 
- The heatmap breakdown is further broken down between all genders and it shows consistency amongst the results above across the board whether it is male, female, or unknown.
- There is an overwhelming amount of Male service subscribers compared to female and unknown while unknown genders tend to be one time customer instead of a subrscriber. 
- The last dashboard of the story is a summary of the analysis between all three categories. This shows that there is a much higher number of males than all the other gender. There is a more consistent base of customers that are born after the 70's and into the 2000's however there are still spikes of older age customers that have much higher trip duration than average. The busiest day is sunday with 408,622 rides.
